Dr. Xianping Du joined the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) in January 2022 as Associate Professor in the School of Ocean Engineering and Technology ([SOET](https://soet.sysu.edu.cn/)). His research focuses on AI-driven structural and multidiciplinary design analysis and optimization. Additionally, he is interested in the structural crashworhiness and dynamical behaviors.

Prior to joining SYSU, Dr. Xu worked in Rutgers University, USA (2020-2022). He was working on a US DOE supported project for the development of a control co-design platform for floaitng offshore wind turbines (FOWT) with multi-fidelity simulation methods. In addition, he also involved in the FOCAL project for validating the software platform using the FOWT model experiments.

He received his B.S. in Vehicle Engineering from Shandong University of Technology, China (2012), M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Hunan University, China (2015), and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, USA (2019). In the Ph.D. dissertation, an interpretable methodology was developed for the design of hierarchical and complex systems based on machine learning techniques.
