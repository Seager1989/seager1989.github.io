Our students have applied and approved two projects of College Students' Innovative Entrepreneurial Training Plan Program (CSIETPP). They are related to the mainteance and design of the floating offshore wind turbines. Details can refer to the following statements.

***

#### Project#1 
## Member: 
<ul>
    <li>Yuchuan Yan (Leader, Grade2021)</li>
    <li>Huan Du (Grade2021)</li>
    <li>Xiaoyi Chen (Grade2021)</li>
    <li>Kuanyou Sun (Grade2020)</li>
    <li>Chengliang Liu (Grade2022)</li>
</ul>

## Aims:
<ul>
    <li>To Investigate the material failure modes of wind turbines blade as crashing with a mainteance UAV</li>
    <li>To recognize the failure modes by well know interpretable machine learning algorithm, random forest</li>
    <li>To develop a new random forest algorithm for learning from engineering uncertain data</li>
</ul>

#### Project#2
## Member: 
<ul>
    <li>Jianbo Yi(Leader, Grade2021)</li>
    <li>Shiting Wang (Grade2021)</li>
    <li>WenXu Liu (Grade2022)</li>
    <li>Junwei Gao (Grade2022)</li>
    <li>Guosheng Yu (Grade2021)</li>
</ul>

## Aims:
<ul>
    <li>To investigate the dynamic behaviors of floating offshore wind turbine platform under varied damping of TMD structural control by model experiments</li>
    <li>To develop the contruction scheme for configuring different control strategies conveniently for platform</li>
    <li>To extablish the technical route by circulating water channel experiment using a 3D printed demo</li>
</ul>
